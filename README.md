#Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera)

The R code is all aggregated into one script that, when run, will execute all the command necessary to read
in the data files and return a final data set that conforms to the requirements of step 5 of the 
project instructions.

The final data set has 86 columns and 36 rows.

The columns are the variables, which I have given marginally more descriptive column names.
There is one row per subject and one row per activity.
The values are the means of each variable for each subject and each activity.
